## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices to be followed during the development of the Carpooling App. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure code quality, maintainability, security, and consistency across the codebase.

---

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Next.js)
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** Supabase or Firebase
- **APIs:** Google Maps API
- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend), Render or Firebase (backend)

---

## 3. General Coding Standards

- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent code style across all files and modules.
- **Indentation:** Use soft tabs (2 spaces) for indentation.
- **Whitespace:** Use whitespace to improve readability; separate logical blocks with blank lines.
- **Naming Conventions:** Use descriptive, camelCase (JavaScript/TypeScript) or snake_case (SQL/Supabase) names.
- **TypeScript:** Use explicit type annotations for variables, function parameters, and return types. Prefer interfaces for object shapes and type aliases for complex types.
- **ES6+ Features:** Use ES6+ features such as arrow functions, destructuring, and async/await.

## 4. Security Best Practices

- **Authentication:** Use secure authentication methods (Supabase Auth, JWT, or Firebase Auth). Require email verification for new users.
- **Authorization:** Implement least privilege; only allow users to access data and features they are authorized for.
- **Input Validation:** Always validate user input on both client and server sides to prevent injection attacks.
- **Output Encoding:** Encode data before displaying it to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Secure Communication:** Use HTTPS for all API calls and data transmission.
- **Secure Storage:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Use secure token storage for sessions.
- **Error Handling:** Do not expose sensitive information in error messages. Log errors securely.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep dependencies and libraries up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.

## 5. Frontend Guidelines

- **Component-Based Design:** Use React components for UI elements, favoring reusable and modular components.
- **State Management:** Use state management libraries (e.g., React Query, useSWR) for efficient data fetching and state synchronization.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the UI is mobile-first and responsive across devices.
- **Inline Styles:** Avoid inline CSS. Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling.
- **Accessibility:** Follow accessibility best practices for inclusive design.

---

## 6. Backend Guidelines

- **API Security:** Secure API endpoints with authentication and authorization checks.
- **Database Access:** Use prepared statements and ORM tools to prevent SQL injection.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging for user activities and monitor for suspicious behavior.
- **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive configuration in environment variables, not in code.
- **Error Handling:** Handle errors gracefully and log relevant details for debugging.

---

## 7. Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for critical functions and components.
- **Integration Testing:** Test integration between frontend, backend, and database.
- **Manual Testing:** Perform manual testing for user flows and edge cases.
- **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews to ensure adherence to standards and catch issues early.
- **Security Testing:** Perform periodic security audits and penetration testing.

---

## 8. Documentation

- **Code Comments:** Comment code where necessary to explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions.
- **API Documentation:** Document API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.
- **Project Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation for setup, deployment, and usage.

---

## 9. Deployment and Maintenance

- **CI/CD:** Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Monitoring:** Use monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry, Google Analytics) to track application health and usage.
- **Feedback Loop:** Collect user feedback and analyze usage data to guide improvements.

---

## 10. Conclusion

Adhering to these coding best practices will help ensure the Carpooling App is secure, maintainable, scalable, and user-friendly. Regular review and updates to these guidelines are encouraged as the project evolves.
